#This project is no longer available on GitHub
Because [GitHub went full SJW](http://www.businessinsider.com/github-the-full-inside-story-2016-2?r=US&IR=T), I have moved all of my remotely important repositories to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/u/Zatherz). GitLab is a very similiar platform, except the fact that they do not alienate users like GitHub does, or at least not yet.

If there is no repository with this name on my GitLab profile, that means I got rid of it, probably because it had a very niche use, was not close to completion or I just got bored of it.

All commits from this repository have been forcefully deleted. Quit GitHub.
